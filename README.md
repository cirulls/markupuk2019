## Code and documentation for the paper XSpec in the Cloud with Diamonds

This repository contains code examples and documentation for [the paper XSpec in the Cloud with Diamonds](https://sandrocirulli.net/site/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paper_xspec_in_the_cloud_with_diamonds.pdf) presented at [Markup UK 2019](https://markupuk.org). 

The configuration can be split in two parts:

1. [CloudFormation configuration](cloudformation/README.md)
2. [Lambda configuration](lambda/README.md)

I also include some dummy examples of [xslt](https://github.com/cirulls/markupuk2019/tree/master/xslt) and [xspec](https://github.com/cirulls/markupuk2019/tree/master/xspec) code to get you started. 

If you use this code, I would be interested in knowing how you are getting on. Feel free to get in touch by raising an [issue](https://github.com/cirulls/markupuk2019/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/cirulls/markupuk2019/pulls).
